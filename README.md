# IMAGE-GENERATION-USING-COMFYUI-AND-STABLE-DIFFUSION
This is my Internship Project as part of AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham â€“ A joint CSR initiative of Microsoft & SAP

This project demonstrates the use of Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI for generating images from text prompts. ComfyUI's node-based interface provides a flexible and powerful way to design and execute complex image generation workflows, making Stable Diffusion more accessible and controllable.
